                            Add the given value to each trackpoint

    Example: tcxmill.py activity.tcx --speeds 11.5 14.0 11.5 --units mi/h

# Features

* Read and write tcx format
* Supports a variety of units
* Handles device pauses (if they last longer than 10s)
* Handle Strava peculiarities, i.e. XML namespaces

# Requirements

* python3

# Assumptions

The assumptions behind tcxmill are:

* You use a treadmill
* You use Garmin Connect and Strava
* You don't use your device's lap key, and:
    * You know the treadmill speed of each segment of your workout.
    * You know the treadmill distance of each segment of your workout.
* (Optional) You use your device's lap key to transition through your structured workout, and
    * You know the treadmill speed of each segment of your workout.
    * The treadmill speed of each lap is constant
        * i.e. if you need to change the treadmill speed, press the lap key on your device. It does not matter if you press the lap key before, during, or after the change in speed; the acceleration will not be accounted for.

# Example 1

A workout where the lap key was used. Export your workout from Garmin Connect to TCX.

Strava charts for the above workout: 
![alt text][summary-before]
![alt text][charts-before]

If the activity has been previously uploaded to Strava, you must delete it or you will get a duplicate activity error. 

* **Warning**  Deleting an activity will delete all kudos and comments for that activity. 

* **Warning** TCX does not have temperature data. If your activity with temperature data automatically synced from Garmin Connect, you will lose this field on Strava.

Run tcxmill, passing in the workout structure. The structure of the above workout is

* 3km at 11.5km/h
* 6km at 14.0km/h
* 1km at 11.5km/h
* 5km at 14.1km/h
* 1km at 11.5km/h
* 4km at 14.2km/h
* 1km at 11.5km/h
* 3km at 14.3km/h
* 1km at 11.5km/h
* 2km at 14.4km/h
* 1km at 11.5km/h
* 1km at 14.5km/h
* 1km at 11.5km/h

# Example 2

[Original TCX workout](./res/10km-2019-10-18/activity.tcx)

Another workout where the lap key was used. Strava before tcxmill: 
![alt text][10km-charts-before]

    python3 tcxmill.py activity.tcx --speeds 11.5 -u km/h                         
    Warning: assuming the device was paused during trackpoint with very long duration 114.0s
    {"Lap": {"Distance": "10002m", "Cumulative": "10002m", "Speed": "3.19 m/s", "Completed": "2019-10-18 10:41:20"}}

**Note** The warning above shows that tcxmill detected a device pause. The device is assumed paused if a trackpoint lasts longer than 10s. tcxmill assumes zero speed during a device pause. This is useful if you need to jump off the treadmill for e.g. a bathroom break or your workout has rest intervals.
